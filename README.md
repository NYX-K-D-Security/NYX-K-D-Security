### üíº How I Secure Your Business: My Services

My approach is simple: I find your vulnerabilities, explain the real-world business risk, and provide clear, actionable guidance to fix them. By combining advanced automation with deep manual expertise, I offer:

*   **1. Hybrid Penetration Testing:**
    *   My process begins with a highly efficient, automated analysis to rapidly identify a broad spectrum of vulnerabilities across your web and mobile applications. This is followed by meticulous manual testing, where I uncover the complex logic flaws that scanners alone cannot find.

*   **2. Source Code Security Review:**
    *   Why wait for an attack? I will analyze your application's source code (`Python`, `Java`, `PHP`, etc.) to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities at their root, long before they reach production.

*   **3. Actionable Risk & Vulnerability Reports:**
    *   You won't get a confusing list of technical jargon. You will receive a detailed, prioritized report that clearly explains:
        *   **The Vulnerability:** What is the weakness?
        *   **The Business Impact:** How can this hurt your business?
        *   **The Fix:** Step-by-step instructions for your developers.

*   **4. Strategic Security & Risk Advisory:**
    *   Beyond finding individual bugs, I help you build a stronger security foundation. I provide consultation on risk management, security policy development, and designing more resilient systems from the ground up.

### üéØ My 15-Category Vulnerability Classification System

My expertise is focused on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across the entire development lifecycle, based on my comprehensive 15-category classification system:

<br>

*   **1. Injection Flaws:** `SQLi`, `Command Injection (RCE)`, `LFI/RFI`, `SSTI`, `XXE`.
*   **2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** `Reflected`, `Stored`, `DOM-based`.
*   **3. Broken Access Control:** `IDOR`, `Privilege Escalation`, `Path Traversal`.
*   **4. Security Misconfiguration:** `Sensitive Data Exposure` (`.git`, `.env`), `Missing Security Headers`.
*   **5. Broken Authentication:** `Session Fixation`, `Credential Stuffing`, `Weak Password Policies`.
*   **6. Advanced Logic Flaws:** `SSRF`, `CSRF`, `Insecure Deserialization`, `Race Conditions`.
*   **7. Sensitive Data Exposure:** `API Data Leakage`, `Backup File Exposure`, `Verbose Errors`.
*   **8. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** `Outdated Libraries`, `Unpatched Frameworks`.
*   **9. Cryptographic Failures:** `Weak Hashing`, `Predictable Tokens`, `Hardcoded Keys`.
*   **10. Insecure Design:** `Missing Rate Limiting`, `User Enumeration`, `Business Logic Flaws`.
*   **11. Network-Level Vulnerabilities:** `Unnecessary Open Ports`, `Firewall Misconfiguration`.
*   **12. OS & Server-Level Vulnerabilities:** `Insecure File Permissions`, `Outdated Server Software`.
*   **13. Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:** *(This section is intentionally omitted as it is not my current focus)*.
*   **14. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** *(Covered under Advanced Logic Flaws)*.
*   **15. DNS-Level Attacks:** `DNS Cache Poisoning`.
